## Overview

### The challenge
A single-page portfolio website using HTML, CSS (Written in SCSS, autoprefixed and minified using Gulp), JavaScript (uglified using Gulp), jQuery for Ajax, and PHP for the backend form processing and emailing of the data.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS > Autoprefixer > CSS > Minified CSS (using Gulp)
- Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript > Uglified JS (Using Gulp)
- jQuery for Ajax on the form data.
- PHP for backend processing of the form data
- Gulp for automation and task running

### What I learned

1. I've dabbled a bit in Node.js, but I'm not proficient in backend development yet, so the PHP script was difficult. But I found the resources I needed to get it working!

2. I've tried to avoid jQuery when it comes to transitions and things. I've preferred instead to try and accomplish what I want to do using vanilla JS and CSS transitions. But I found that one of the better use-cases for jQuery is handling Ajax data. It's so much more intuitive than vanilla JS for this work.

### Continued development

On to React!!
